# Movelize
A Genesis starter child theme that applies Bootstrap grid CSS classes to the Genesis HTML markup through custom filters and actions. The theme filters the Genesis CSS classes to apply the Bootstrap `container` `row`and `column grid`classes.
Those modifications are done in *lib/bootstrap/bootstrap-markup.php*.
